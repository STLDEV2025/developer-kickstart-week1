# Developer Kickstart Week 1: Variables, Data Types, and Operators in Apex

This project is part of the Developer Kickstart Week 1 curriculum at Cloud Code Academy. It's designed to help beginner Salesforce developers learn and practice using variables, data types, and operators in the Apex programming language.

## Goals of the Practice

Through this practice project, you'll gain foundational knowledge about:

- Different data types in Apex, such as Integer, Decimal, Double, String, Boolean, and more.
- How to declare and use variables in Apex.
- How to use various operators in Apex, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

This foundational knowledge will prepare you for more advanced topics in Salesforce development.

## Setup

To get started, you'll need a Salesforce Trailhead Playground. If you don't have one, you can create it for free from any Trailhead module.

After you've set up your Trailhead Playground:

1. Install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Install Salesforce Extension Pack in Visual Studio Code. This can be done by searching 'Salesforce Extension Pack' in the Extensions view in VS Code and clicking Install.
3. Authorize your Trailhead Playground in Visual Studio Code. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette and type 'SFDX: Authorize an Org', then press Enter. Follow the steps in the browser to log in to your Playground, then return to VS Code.
4. Deploy the Apex Class by right clicking on the `VariablesDatatypesOperators` and  `VariablesDatatypesOperatorsTest` file a using the option SFDX: Deploy Source to Org.

## Running the Test Classes

To run the test classes:

1. Open the command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P`.
2. Type 'SFDX: Invoke Apex Tests...', and press Enter.
3. In the 'Select Test Class' input, select the test class you want to run and press Enter.
4. The test results will appear in the Output panel at the bottom of the screen. You can switch to the 'Test' tab in this panel to see a summary of the test run.
